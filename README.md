# Road-Accident-Dashboard

This report presents an analysis of road accident casualties based on several factors, including accident severity, vehicle type, road type, surface condition, and the time of day or night. The analysis is designed to highlight key insights into patterns of accidents and provide actionable conclusions for improving road safety.

Q1. Total Casualties & Percentage of Total with Respect to Accident Severity.

Ans-Accident severity typically includes three categories:
1-Fatal
2-Serious
3-Slight
Analysis Approach:
Total Casualties:
1-Sum up the number of casualties for each severity level.
2-Calculate the percentage of total casualties for each category.

Q2- Maximum Casualties by Type of Vehicle.
Ans-Understanding which types of vehicles are involved in accidents resulting in the most casualties is crucial for targeted safety interventions.
Analysis Approach:
1-Group(By Using Pivote table in excel) accidents by vehicle type (e.g., car, motorcycle, truck, bicycle, bus).
2-Identify the vehicle type with the highest number of casualties.

Q3- Total Casualties Comparison with Respect to Vehicle Type
Ans- comparative analysis is conducted to show the distribution of total casualties across different vehicle types.
Analysis Approach:
1-Group (By Using Pivote table in excel) data by vehicle type.
2-Compare the casualty counts for each type of vehicle over a given period.

Q4- Maximum Casualties by Road Type
Ans- Different road types (e.g. rural roads, urban streets) can have varying levels of risk, affecting accident rates and casualty severity.
Analysis Approach:
1-Group (By Using Pivote table in excel)accidents by road type.
2-Identify the road type with the highest number of casualties.

Q5- Distribution of Total Casualties by Road Surface
Ans- The condition of the road surface (e.g., wet, dry, icy) can significantly impact the likelihood and severity of accidents.
Analysis Approach:
1-Categorize casualties by road surface conditions.
2-Compare the total casualties across each surface condition.

Q6-Relation Between Casualties by Area/Location & Day/Night
Ans-Understanding the relationship between casualties, the area or location (e.g., urban vs. rural), and whether accidents occur during the day or night is vital for targeted road safety strategies.
Analysis Approach:
1-Group data by area (urban/rural) and time of day (day/night).
2-Compare casualty counts across these categories.


Conclusion:
The analysis provides several key takeaways:
1-Slight injuries account for the majority of total casualties, but fatal accidents need urgent attention due to their severity.
2-Cars and motorcycles are involved in the majority of casualties.
3-Urban area contains maximum casualties.
3-Wet/icy road conditions pose significant risks.
4-Casualty trends reveal seasonal patterns, and night-time accidents in rural areas need additional safety measures such as better lighting or road signs.
5-These insights can guide stakeholders in formulating road safety policies and improving infrastructure to reduce accident rates and casualties.
